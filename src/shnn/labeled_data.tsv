2405	neutral	1	MOAI	daidzin	This, together with the finding that daidzin does not affect the rates of mitochondria-catalyzed oxidative deamination of these monoamines, raised the possibility that the ethanol intake-suppressive (antidipsotropic) action of daidzin is not mediated by the monoamines but rather by their reactive biogenic aldehyde intermediates such as 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde (5-HIAL) and/or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) which accumulate in the presence of daidzin.
2406	neutral	1	MOAI	daidzin	To further evaluate this possibility, we synthesized more structural analogues of daidzin and tested and compared their antidipsotropic activities in Syrian golden hamsters with their effects on monoamine metabolism in isolated hamster liver mitochondria using 5-HT as the substrate.

2410	neutral	1	MOAI	uricase	Uricase, ascorbic oxidase and monoamine oxidase are not affected.
2411	positive	2	MOAI	daidzin	Using isolated hamster liver mitochondria and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) as the substrates, we demonstrated that daidzin inhibits the second but not the first step of the MAO/ALDH-2 pathway, the major pathway that catalyzes monoamine metabolism in mitochondria.
2412	positive	2	MOAI	glutaminase	We found increased glutaminase and GABA transaminase (GABA-T) expression and decreased monoamine oxidase B expression in Fmr1 KO astrocytes.
2413	positive	2	MOAI	dicoumarol	We suggest that DT-diaphorase plays a neuroprotective role in dopaminergic neurons, which is supported by the following observations: (i) Cu-toxicity is dependent on DT-diaphorase inhibition with dicoumarol in RCSN-3 cells derived from the rat substantia nigra; (ii) the cytotoxic effect of monoamine oxidase-A inhibitor amiflamine in RCSN-3 cells is increased by 2.4-fold (p < 0.001) in the presence of the inhibitor of DT-diaphorase, dicoumarol; (iii) concomitant intracerebral administration of manganese (Mn3+) together with the DT-diaphorase inhibitor dicoumarol into the left medial forebrain bundle produced a behavioral pattern characterized by contralateral rotational behavior when the rats were stimulated with apomorphine, in a manner similar to that observed in animals injected unilaterally with 6-hydroxydopamine; (iv) incubation of RCSN-3 cells with salsolinol in the presence of DT-diaphorase inhibitor significantly decreased cell survival by 2.5-fold (p < 0.001).

2429	positive	2	Analgesics	nonivamide	We conclude that nonivamide treatment exerts analgesic action in chronic low back pain and causes the release of the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory neuropeptide somatostatin which may play pivotal role in the pain-relieving effect.
2430	neutral	1	Analgesics	ginkgetin	When analgesic activity was measured, ginkgetin showed a dose-dependent inhibition in an animal model of acetic acid-induced writhing.

2432	positive	2	Bronchodialators	s. officinalis	These results indicate that the crude extract of S.officinalis possesses bronchodilatory activity mediated predominantly via activation of voltage-dependent K(+) channels and inhibition of phosphodiesterase enzyme; thus, this study provides sound pharmacological basis for its medicinal use in hyperactive airways disorders such as asthma and cough.
2433	neutral	1	Bronchodialators	salvia officinalis	The aqueous methanolic extract of the aerial parts of Salviaofficinalis (So.Cr) was studied to provide possible underlying mechanism(s) for its medicinal use in asthma using the in vivo bronchodilatory assay and isolated tracheal preparations.

2438	neutral	1	Bronchodialators	foeniculum vulgare	However with regard to the effect of KCl on calcium channels, the results indicated that the inhibitory effect of ethanol extracts and essential oil from Foeniculum vulgare on calcium channels is not contributing to their relaxant (bronchodilatory) effects on guinea pig tracheal chains.
2439	neutral	1	Bronchodialators	borago officinalis	In this study, we investigated the crude extract of Borago officinalis leaves (Bo.Cr) for its antispasmodic, bronchodilator, vasodilator and cardio-depressant activities to rationalize some of the traditional uses.

2441	neutral	1	Bronchodialators	15-hete	Loss of the bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory properties of epithelial PGE2, with or without increased 15-HETE, might contribute to ozone-induced airway dysfunction.

2443	neutral	1	Bronchodialators	amoxycillin	Participants were children aged 2-59 months of age, who received either oral amoxycillin (31-54 mg/Kg/day, in three divided doses for three days) or placebo, and standard bronchodilator therapy.

2464	negative	0	Bronchodialators	2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone	The study showed that the content of aldehyde- and ketoderivatives of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones of neutral character in the expired air condensate (AKDNPH) was presumably higher in patients with the exercise-induced bronchial asthma thus indicating the more significant activity of the inflammatory process in bronchi under the studied phenotype of the disease.

2466	positive	2	Bronchodialators	apricot	This result suggests that pre-treatment of ipratropium bromide protects SO2-induced bronchoconstriction in healthy worker during apricot sulfurization processes that causes asthma-like syndrome in agricultural environment.
2467	negative	0	Bronchodialators	citral	It was found that propranolol, but not indomethacin and L-NAME, reversed bronchodilatory effects of both ginger oil and citral, suggesting that a possible mechanism involved -adrenergic receptor.
2468	neutral	1	Bronchodialators	tantalum	While tantalum bronchography has been used in the past to measure one-dimensional airway diameter changes, this method has inherent problems associated with the irritant effects of tantalum.
