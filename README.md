## Supervised Human Neural Network (SHNN)

This repository holds the source code for a research experiment conducted in 2017 called the Supervised Human Neural Network (SHNN).

### Summary

In order to explore how information moves through human networks we use a
structured network design from artificial neural networks to impose
a deliberate structure on human networks. This acts to quantify how strategic arrangement
might affect information transmission between units in a coordinated task. We hypothesize
that human networks might perform more accurate classifications simply as a result of how
units acting as nodes are structurally configured.


### Code

The experiment was conducted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform using a modified
version of [Otree](https://github.com/oTree-org/oTree), a platform for social science
experiments.

The source code for the experiment will be added to this repository for
replicability and further experimentation.
